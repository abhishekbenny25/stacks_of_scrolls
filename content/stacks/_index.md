## 📜 Welcome to Stacks of Scrolls!! 

These are my notes from life as a data-oriented process engineer, plus updates from the personal projects I build on the side. I’m here to share the learnings I’ve picked up over the years - tools, workflows, and hard-won lessons that might be useful to you too.

**Beware: Here be dragons (in the data)**
